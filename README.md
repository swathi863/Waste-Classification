## Project Description  
Plastic pollution is a growing concern globally, and effective waste segregation is critical to tackling this issue. This project employs a CNN model to classify plastic waste into distinct categories, facilitating automated waste management.  

## Dataset  
The dataset used for this project is the *Waste Classification Data* by Sashaank Sekar. It contains a total of 25,077 labeled images, divided into two categories: *Organic* and *Recyclable*. This dataset is designed to facilitate waste classification tasks using machine learning techniques.  


### Key Details:
- *Total Images*: 25,077  
  - *Training Data*: 22,564 images (85%)  
  - *Test Data*: 2,513 images (15%)  
- *Classes*: Organic and Recyclable  
- *Purpose*: To aid in automating waste management and reducing the environmental impact of improper waste disposal.
  
### Approach:  
- Studied waste management strategies and white papers.  
- Analyzed the composition of household waste.  
- Segregated waste into two categories (Organic and Recyclable).  
- Leveraged IoT and machine learning to automate waste classification.  

### Dataset Link:  
You can access the dataset here: [Waste Classification Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/techsash/waste-classification-data).  

Note: Ensure appropriate dataset licensing and usage guidelines are followed.  


## Model Architecture  
The CNN architecture includes:  
- *Convolutional Layers:* Feature extraction  
- *Pooling Layers:* Dimensionality reduction  
- *Fully Connected Layers:* Classification  
- *Activation Functions:* ReLU and Softmax  



## Training  
- *Optimizer:* Adam  
- *Loss Function:* Categorical Crossentropy  
- *Epochs:* Configurable (default: 25)  
- *Batch Size:* Configurable (default: 32)  

Data augmentation techniques were utilized to enhance model performance and generalizability.
